# Welcome to the blue dwarf
A small application allowing to discretely go outdoor, when your corporate proxy won't give you such liberty.

## Features
* Allows use of two nested proxy servers
* Handles HTTP or SOCKS proxy server (SOCKS to be done)
* Exposes a local SOCKS proxy server
* Uses IE to send keepalive signal to corporate proxy

## Download

### If your proxy and firewall are cool enough
You can use the **[ClickOnce installer](http://openstore.craponne.fr/BlueDwarf.application)**.

### If it is not cool enough to allow ClickOnce
You can still **[download the application directly](http://openstore.craponne.fr/BlueDwarf.exe)**.  
Then, simply launch the application, it will register to start automatically next time.
